Re: New Sequences Window,"    Date:        Tue, 20 Aug 2002 17:27:47 -0500
    From:        Chris Garrigues 
    Message-ID:  


  | I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are
  | purely cosmetic changes.

Well, first, when exmh (the latest one with your changes) starts, I get...

can't read ""flist(totalcount,unseen)"": no such element in array
    while executing
""if {$flist(totalcount,$mhProfile(unseen-sequence)) > 0} {
	FlagInner spool iconspool labelup
    } else {
	FlagInner down icondown labeldown
    }""
    (procedure ""Flag_MsgSeen"" line 3)
    invoked from within

    (procedure ""Msg_Show"" line 7)
    invoked from within

""Folder_Change $exmh(folder)""
    (procedure ""Exmh"" line 101)
    invoked from within
""Exmh""
    (""after"" script)

which is probably related to my not having an ""unseen"" sequence anywhere
(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...

Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with.   There's obviously a way as the ""Sequences"" menu does this.
The ""Mark Unseen"" menu entry in the message ""More"" menu is still wanting
that function as well...

  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
  | display the other sequences.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).

I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).

I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
the ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).

I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)

Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...

syntax error in expression ""int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))""
    while executing
""expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))""

    (procedure ""tkButtonUp"" line 7)
    invoked from within
""tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick
""
    (command bound to event)

It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject
to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
Looks as if something is now saying ""1 hit"" when before it didn't, or
similar.

  | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
  | week or so ago.

Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).

Hope this helps.

ASK THE FOOL

Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? 

A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. 

Full Answer:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562069

YOUR MONEY 

RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070

Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 

1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 

2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072

3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073

4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074

5. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075

If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it 
alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your 
finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOTLIGHT

SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 

We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.

Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
COMMUNITY TIPS

DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 

-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 

-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 

-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 

-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.

-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 

-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 

Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

No it wasn't, and at one point it worked fine.  I'll check and see why it 
stopped working.

I've never seen pseq either.

BTW, it's kinda amusing for a short while to show the cur sequence.  Watching 
that helped me find a number of bugs.

In this issue:

* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
* European Union bans spam

IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT THIS MESSAGE: Please see the
""About This Message"" section at the end.

- --------------------------------------------------------------

* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill

Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.

The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.

CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.

Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630:

 http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml

We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.

* European Union bans spam

GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE

May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.

""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.""

While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.

""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""

""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""

More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site ,
and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
. More information on
the international CAUCE network of affiliate organizations is
available at .

THE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
==============================

The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But
why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  

The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
quickly.

The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
critical steps to compliance.

In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
parts).

In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).

It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
of terms.  

Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
ISO17799, it can be invaluable.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
=========================================

The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.

Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
target even realizing that they have parted with it.

The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  

The following are some of the major techniques employed:

BAITING
This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.

PULLING RANK
This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
assumed. 

EXHAUSTING
This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
the target.

SURF BOARDING
Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
doorway, etc.

SURVEYS
The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.


There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. 

Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:

a) the sensitivity of the information
b) your authority to exchange or release the information
c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
d) the purpose of the exchange

The act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.



ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA =================================

Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
embracing it with enthusiasm.

To illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
500 from the download location.

That aside, the table makes interesting reading:

STRANGER DANGER
===============

As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
you deal with them every day... but now look again.

If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
you see?

The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. 

This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
due caution is not exercised.

The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
minimized:

* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
that visitors wear them

* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.

* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges

* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours

* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
are doing

* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
don't let them make their way to you

* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID

* Do not leave visitors alone   



ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==========================================

1) How many controls are there in the standard?
Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
over 500 detailed controls in total.

2) What is part 2?
Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
build and operate an information security management system.

3) How old is it?
The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.

4) What is accreditation?
An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
different countries.

5) Is certification for life?
No. It is normally for three year periods.

6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Norway, UK and USA, amongst others.

7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
No. It is generic in terms of legislation.



CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
============================================

The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
especially when making payments over the Internet.  

Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
which can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively
simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
year.  

We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
risks involved in credit card transactions:

* Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
purchases.

* All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.

* Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
secure connection.

* If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be
extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
security!

* If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
talking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the
organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
pay by some other means.

* Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
transactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.

ISO17799 SECTION 11: BCP REVIEW 
===============================

Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
continuity plan.

Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
expensive, etc.

Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
MS-Word: The BCP Generator.

This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
active use in over 40 countries.
  
With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.

IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?
====================================

Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:


1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
outside until just after normal trading time.

He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. 

The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.

He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
loss!


2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
(which had never been changed!). 

This gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for
himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
with the dial back system.

Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
of evenings.

To recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
cost.


3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
spiral. 

Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
short circuit.

When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
company lost at least 500,000 UKP.

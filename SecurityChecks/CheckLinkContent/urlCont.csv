            Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?

            Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

        Unlock your wallet to see your address  
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!
         
      You arrived via a link that has the address, amount, gas or data fields filled in for you. You can change any information before sending. Unlock your wallet to get started.

        This page allows you to download different versions of private keys and re-print your paper wallet. You may want to do this in order to [import your account into Geth/Mist](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/how-to-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth/). If you want to check your balance, we recommend using a blockchain explorer like etherscan.io.
       
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!

            Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

        Unlock your wallet to see your address  
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!
         
      You arrived via a link that has the address, amount, gas or data fields filled in for you. You can change any information before sending. Unlock your wallet to get started.

        This page allows you to download different versions of private keys and re-print your paper wallet. You may want to do this in order to [import your account into Geth/Mist](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/how-to-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth/). If you want to check your balance, we recommend using a blockchain explorer like etherscan.io.
       
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!

            MyEtherWallet is not a Bank
           
            MyEtherWallet is an Interface
           

              I already know what a blockchain is...
            
 
            Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?
           
            Why are you making me read all this?
           
            If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point?
           
            How To Protect Yourself from Phishers
           
            Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

        Unlock your wallet to see your address  
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!
         
      You arrived via a link that has the address, amount, gas or data fields filled in for you. You can change any information before sending. Unlock your wallet to get started.

            {{objDomainSale.name}}.eth
           

              Set either of both of the prices below to offer your domain for sale.  Remember that any funds you have locked in the domain's deed will go to the buyer and 10% of the funds when sold goes to referrers.

        This page allows you to download different versions of private keys and re-print your paper wallet. You may want to do this in order to [import your account into Geth/Mist](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/how-to-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth/). If you want to check your balance, we recommend using a blockchain explorer like etherscan.io.
       
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.

        This page allows you to download different versions of private keys and re-print your paper wallet. You may want to do this in order to [import your account into Geth/Mist](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/how-to-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth/). If you want to check your balance, we recommend using a blockchain explorer like etherscan.io.
       
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!

        Unlock your wallet to see your address  
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!
         
      You arrived via a link that has the address, amount, gas or data fields filled in for you. You can change any information before sending. Unlock your wallet to get started.

        This page allows you to download different versions of private keys and re-print your paper wallet. You may want to do this in order to [import your account into Geth/Mist](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/how-to-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth/). If you want to check your balance, we recommend using a blockchain explorer like etherscan.io.
       
          You may know this as your ""Account #"" or your ""Public Key"". It's what you send people so they can send you ETH. That icon is an easy way to recognize your address.
         
          This Keystore / JSON file matches the format used by Mist & Geth so you can easily import it in the future. It is the recommended file to download and back up.
         
          This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended.
         
          ProTip: If you cannot print this right now, click ""Print"" and save it as a PDF until you are able to get it printed. Remove it from your computer afterwards!

Darbar Culture Festival: Artist Residency Revolution
 Our urban, contemporary and classical festival celebrates the cultural relationship between the UK and the Indian subcontinent and explores the many creative influences generated by our shared and evolving history.

For a week in Leicester, four artists not known to each other, come together for an immersive incubation space to create a new performance piece and soundscape in an Artist Residency Revolution. By navigating their respective identities, cultures, histories and stories, they draw from their individual musical forms – urban, contemporary, and classical genres – to produce something magical.

 Corporate services offered  Trusted by Definition & Coverage Payment data validation also includes another important step in bank validation, the IBAN number to BIC Code conversion ( BIC Codes are managed by SWIFT network ). In short it is the ability to determine the correct BIC code from a given IBAN number. What is the definition of IBAN? The IBAN consists of up to 32 alphanumeric characters, comprising a country code, two check digits and a long and detailed bank account number used in bank wire transfers. The IBAN structure is defined by the international standard under ISO 13616-1:2007 and check digits are performed using MOD 97 (ISO 7064). The individual countries and formatting are described in the official ISO IBAN registry Examples.  The IBAN checker engine supports 97 total countries and all 37 SEPA countries. Our system can respectively identify 97 distinct data structures and perform IBAN format, check digit and length validations. Increasing the success rate of payments is critical to provide higher quality financial services. Automating payment validations can greatly reduce the loss in bank fees for failed/bounced payments.

                                    CIOs are at a juncture in their careers.
                                 
                                    After battling the COVID-19 crisis — which accelerated and solidified digital-first requirements — they’re now faced with pandemic aftereffects: supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a labor shortage; these problems were then compounded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It’s an unstable time — and a career-defining moment for many CIOs. Amid these challenges, CIOs must move IT and their businesses forward.
                                 
                                    IDC has developed a framework for understanding the key areas of success for the Future CIO who will thrive in the new reality. This IDC MaturityScape framework will help you better understand how you compare with other CIOs and accelerate your journey to becoming a more capable leader for your enterprise and your IT organization.

Tor Tor is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to. In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called Tails. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer. Tips Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines.  If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please contact us. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use Tails to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. After If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at https://www.couragefound.org. Submit documents to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives. The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our Tor tab for more information.) We also advise you to read our tips for sources before submitting. If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. Contact us to discuss how to proceed.

198,,198,https://cferecibos.mx/tarjeta-inteligente/,0,"Tarjeta inteligente CFE: conoce todo sobre ella  La tarjeta CFE fue creada por la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) de México en el año 2014 como una alternativa para pagar el servicio de luz. Con ella, se implementaron medidas para que los clientes pudieran pagar su servicio de CFE de forma rápida y sencilla, además de otorgarles la opción de hacer sus pagos de forma mensual. Este es un método de pago renovado, adaptándose a las exigencias y tecnologías de la actualidad. Si quieres saber temas tales como cómo funciona la tarjeta inteligente de CFE, cuánto cuesta la tarjeta CFE, dónde pagar con tu tarjeta CFE, y mucho más, entonces no te pierdas este artículo. 👉 Solicita tu Tarjeta inteligente en la Sucursal mas cercana o de forma online 💳 Contenido ¿Cómo funciona la tarjeta inteligente de CFE? Es un mecanismo que permite a los clientes hacer sus pagos de CFE, con una tarjeta inteligente sin la necesidad de saber su número de servicio o tener un recibo de pago. Solo es necesario disponer de una tarjeta, la cual se encargará de registrar las fechas de pago y te permitirá hacer todos los pagos en cualquier sucursal o cajero de la CFE. Además, brinda una opción de pago mensual, en donde el usuario puede interactuar escogiendo su fecha de pago (1, 5, 10, 15, 20 o 25). El cliente tiene la opción de escoger su período de cobro y podrá adaptar los pagos del servicio a sus necesidades. Otra ventaja es que con esta tarjeta podremos realizar los pagos para la reconexión del servicio eléctrico. Con esta modalidad se ayuda a evitar la deforestación. Es una alternativa novedosa que permite al cliente contribuir con el medio ambiente y tener mayor control de sus pagos. En caso de no gustarle esta modalidad, también puede optar por domiciliar su pago de CFE con tarjeta de crédito (no hay nada como pagar la luz con su tarjeta) o seguir pagando de manera convencional. Hay distintas opciones de pago, aunque pagar con su tarjeta inteligente de CFE es una experiencia única que brinda más ventajas que desventajas. ¿Cuánto cuesta la tarjeta de CFE? Es común, ya sabiendo sobre esta novedosa modalidad de pago, preguntarse cuánto cuesta la tarjeta de CFE. El costo de la tarjeta inteligente CFE es gratuito, aunque reponerla supone el pago del nuevo plástico (consultar lista de costos actuales en la página oficial de la CFE). Es decir, que al hacer la solicitud y al hacer el cambio a esta nueva modalidad, no deberás pagar ningún monto adicional. Disfruta de este beneficio de forma gratuita. ¿Dónde recargar o pagar con tu tarjeta de la CFE? Muchos usuarios dicen, “y ahora que sé todo esto, dónde puedo pagar la luz con la tarjeta inteligente de CFE”.  Pues, la realidad es que hay numerosos medios donde se puede pagar la luz (o donde se puede pagar el servicio de CFE), con tu tarjeta de CFE de forma rápida y sencilla: puedes dirigirte a cualquier sucursal CFE y solicitar pagar el servicio CFE con tu tarjeta (se puede pagar la luz con tarjeta de crédito, débito o en efectivo) como también puedes dirigirte a cualquier cajero y pagar el servicio CFE con tu tarjeta inteligente. Como se observa, solo tienes que dirigirte a cualquier sucursal o cajero automático de CFE con tu tarjeta inteligente y cancelar. No tiene ninguna complicación, ya que tu tarjeta inteligente prácticamente hará todos los trámites por ti. Ventajas de pagar con tarjeta de la CFE de México Hacer el pago con tarjeta inteligente de la CFE de México brinda distintas ventajas tales como: ¿Qué desventaja tiene hacer tus pagos con tarjeta de la CFE de México? ¿Cómo interpretar tu medidor digital para saber cuándo hacer el pago con tu tarjeta inteligente de CFE? El medidor digital siempre te notificará las fechas de tu pago, evitando que se te olvide pagar tus recibos y así no se te suspenda tu servicio de luz. De esta manera, hay que saber interpretar los colores de las luces led que este dispositivo incorpora. Estos son los significados de cada color: Descarga la App CFE Contigo Con la Aplicación CFE Contigo podrás consultar tus facturas de forma fácil y sencilla de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad  Sucursales de la CFE Comentarios"

          Ratings and Reviews
         1.5M Ratings Editors’ Choice From its humble origin as a fun way to send self-erasing photo messages, Snapchat has grown into one of our favorite social media apps. And not just for the hilarious face filters and cool geographical photo tags. It’s become one of the best ways to share memories, maintain friendships, and stay up to date on news and views from our go-to websites. 
    Love it but have suggestions!
 I’ve used Snapchat as my main communication app since it first came out! It’s a great way to stay connected with friends, post polls for my trivia gig, and it’s a relatively safe way to communicate with people met online (like online dating) who you don’t know well enough or aren’t comfortable enough to give your personal number out to. Many great features have been added to Snapchat over the years that are perfect for even simple quality of life and it’s insanely user friendly. However, there are a couple of things that still need fixing or adding even after all these years! First fix is to add a setting to completely turn off the apps shutter sound when taking a picture that doesn’t involve me silencing my phone completely. The sound is incredibly loud and obnoxious and draws WAY too much attention so it’s really gotta go. Second fix is that if a video snap has multiple parts that record smoothly it shouldn’t arrive to you in multiple different notifications! I have several friends who I maintain conversations with using the longer video feature that was added quite a while back which is super fun and convenient but when I receive my friends replies the video will send a notification for each individual section as if they are separate videos/snaps. This is also incredibly obnoxious when I’m in public or at work and can’t turn my phone on silent for whatever reason. 
    Love it 💗
 Kids can have Snapchat and they will enjoy you guys weren’t joy whoever sings this, so Snapchat is like how you could text your family if they have it your friends if they have it your cousins if they have it you can call them and text them and send them a pictures of you and Put filter on you can put filters on it and send them and you get to take a picture and put a filter on or you can watch videos and play games with your cousin in your family your friends or by yourself it’s really fun and I have it for a long long long time, and I really love it you can do it like everything almost everything on it. If you have Snapchat, you don’t need FaceTime what’s up or like I don’t think you can talk with your family or cousins not friends because it’s already on Snapchat everything off that you were really enjoyed that and have you guys looking at this so I have I didn’t mean to Brasilia while I was gonna like tell you guys about it so I am thank you again, so yeah if I messed it up sorry but you would enjoy it. I enjoy it a lot and if you’re good night get it enjoy it because yeah you will you will enjoy it and if someone are you and you do feel like you want to add them because you can if use like you should add them you don’t have to bye💗 oh, and one more thing people you can see people location, but you can take it off if you want to

The biggest factor that makes us human is undeniably our sense of community and our continuous search for connection. Psychedelics have the potential not only to create connections in the brain, but also to connect humans to themselves, to each other and to the environment too.  “To consider something rational and reasonable only if it appears to be so in relation to the broadest and deepest norms - those that are considered most essential for the individual and society.”  Arne Næss - Life’s Philosophy (download ebook) Upcoming ALPS events A one day conference with student speakers from all around Switzerland who are interested in psychedelic research and therapy.  Events and talks in Switzerland Donnerstag, 11. Mai 2023, 13.00–17.00 Uhr  Jugendkulturhaus Dynamo,   Wasserwerkstrasse 21, 8006 Zürich  Ideal für: Fachpersonen  Eintritt: Gratis L’Association ASPT a pour but de réunir les professionnels impliqués et/ou intéressées par la Psychothérapie Assistée par les Psychédéliques (PAP).  La journée sera divisée en deux parties: l'ouverture et l'allocutions des intervenants seront suivie par l'assemble générale constitutive de l'association. From our Blog . . .  Currently, in the field of  psychedelic research, the most popular psychometrically validated instrument is the “Five Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire” (5D-ASC), closely followed by Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30). The latter is used to analyse the general phenomenon of a mystical experience, what the underlying neural mechanisms of it are, and whether it can predict therapeutic efficacy. But how come so many people describe psychedelic experiences as mystical? Or maybe the question is, who started to use this terminology and why? What does the acute effects of psychedelics tell us about synesthesia? Tabea takes a dive into the literature, showing that this intuitive connection might be a bit more complex than you might expect.  Summer is here, and with it the promise of a long awaited vacation.What better time to catch up on some reading? Here are a few recommendations for a psychedelic beach read that are sure to leave you both entertained and informed.

258,,258,https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification,0,"Global Protect yourself from phishing Phishing (pronounced: fishing) is an attack that attempts to steal your money, or your identity, by getting you to reveal personal information -- such as credit card numbers, bank information, or passwords -- on websites that pretend to be legitimate. Cybercriminals typically pretend to be reputable companies, friends, or acquaintances in a fake message, which contains a link to a phishing website. 
Select the headings below for more information
 
Learn to spot a phishing message Phishing is a popular form of cybercrime because of how effective it is. Cybercriminals have been successful using emails, text messages, and direct messages on social media or in video games, to get people to respond with their personal information. The best defense is awareness and knowing what to look for. Here are some ways to recognize a phishing email: 
Urgent call to action or threats - Be suspicious of emails that claim you must click, call, or open an attachment immediately. Often, they'll claim you have to act now to claim a reward or avoid a penalty. Creating a false sense of urgency is a common trick of phishing attacks and scams. They do that so that you won't think about it too much or consult with a trusted advisor who may warn you. Tip: Whenever you see a message calling for immediate action take a moment, pause, and look carefully at the message. Are you sure it's real? Slow down and be safer. 
First time or infrequent senders - While it's not unusual to receive an email from someone for the first time, especially if they are outside your organization, this can be a sign of phishing. When you get an email from somebody you don't recognize, or that Outlook identifies as a new sender, take a moment to examine it extra carefully. 
Spelling and bad grammar - Professional companies and organizations usually have an editorial staff to make sure customers get high-quality, professional content. If an email message has obvious spelling or grammatical errors, it might be a scam. These errors are sometimes the result of awkward translation from a foreign language, and sometimes they're deliberate in an attempt to evade filters that try to block these attacks. 
Generic greetings - An organization that works with you should know your name and these days it's easy to personalize an email. If the email starts with a generic ""Dear sir or madam"" that's a warning sign that it might not really be your bank or shopping site. 
Mismatched email domains - If the email claims to be from a reputable company, like Microsoft or your bank, but the email is being sent from another email domain like Gmail.com, or microsoftsupport.ru it's probably a scam. Also be watchful for very subtle misspellings of the legitimate domain name. Like micros0ft.com where the second ""o"" has been replaced by a 0, or rnicrosoft.com, where the ""m"" has been replaced by an ""r"" and a ""n"". These are common tricks of scammers.  
Suspicious links or unexpected attachments - If you suspect that an email message is a scam, don't open any links or attachments that you see. Instead, hover your mouse over, but don't click, the link to see if the address matches the link that was typed in the message. In the following example, resting the mouse over the link reveals the real web address in the box with the yellow background. Note that the string of numbers looks nothing like the company's web address. 

 Tip: On Android long-press the link to get a properties page that will reveal the true destination of the link. On iOS do what Apple calls a ""Light, long-press"". Cybercriminals can also tempt you to visit fake websites with other methods, such as text messages or phone calls. Sophisticated cybercriminals set up call centers to automatically dial or text numbers for potential targets. These messages will often include prompts to get you to enter a PIN number or some other type of personal information. For more information see How to spot a ""fake order"" scam.  
Are you an administrator or IT pro?
 If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription with Advanced Threat Protection you can enable ATP Anti-phishing to help protect your users. Learn more 
If you receive a phishing email Never click any links or attachments in suspicious emails. If you receive a suspicious message from an organization and worry the message could be legitimate, go to your web browser and open a new tab. Then go to the organization's website from your own saved favorite, or via a web search. Or call the organization using a phone number listed on the back of a membership card, printed on a bill or statement, or that you find on the organization's official website. If the suspicious message appears to come from a person you know, contact that person via some other means such as text message or phone call to confirm it. Report the message (see below). Delete it. 
How to report a phishing scam 
Microsoft 365 Outlook - With the suspicious message selected, choose Report message from the ribbon, and then select Phishing. This is the fastest way to report it and remove the message from your Inbox, and it will help us improve our filters so that you see fewer of these messages in the future. For more information see Use the Report Message add-in. 
Outlook.com - Select the check box next to the suspicious message in your Outlook.com inbox. Select the arrow next to Junk, and then select Phishing. Note: If you're using an email client other than Outlook, start a new email to phish@office365.microsoft.com and include the phishing email as an attachment. Please don't forward the suspicious email; we need to receive it as an attachment so we can examine the headers on the message.  
If you’re on a suspicious website:
 While you’re on a suspicious site in Microsoft Edge, select the Settings and More (…) icon towards the top right corner of the window, then Help and feedback > Report unsafe site.  Or click here. Tip: ALT+F will open the Settings and More menu. For more information see Securely browse the web in Microsoft Edge. 
What to do if you think you've been successfully phished If you're suspicious that you may have inadvertently fallen for a phishing attack there are a few things you should do.  While it's fresh in your mind write down as many details of the attack as you can recall. In particular try to note any information such as usernames, account numbers, or passwords you may have shared. Immediately change the passwords on those affected accounts, and anywhere else that you might use the same password. While you're changing passwords you should create unique passwords for each account, and you might want to see Create and use strong passwords. Confirm that you have multifactor authentication (also known as two-step verification) turned on for every account you can. See What is: Multifactor authentication If this attack affects your work or school accounts you should notify the IT support folks at your work or school of the possible attack. If you shared information about your credit cards or bank accounts you may want to contact those companies as well to alert them to possible fraud. If you've lost money, or been the victim of identity theft, report it to local law enforcement. The details in step 1 will be very helpful to them. See also
